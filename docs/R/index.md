# R Basics / Introduction
_Last updated on 21 Jan 18_

In this section you will find my documentation of basic R programming knowledge picked up while taking the [HarvardX's Data Science: R Basics](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+PH125.1x+2T2017/course/) course.

I started the course on 4 Dec 17 and completed it on 21 Jan 18.
