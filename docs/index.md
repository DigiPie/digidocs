# DigiDocs

## What is this

DigiDocs is a collection of concise, to-the-point tutorials for technologies such as Git, Linux and C. These tutorials are organised under chapters such as Git, Linux and C.

## Who is this for

It started out being a way for [me](http://www.evantay.com) to document what I learn in a concise manner. I did so because I wanted to minimise time spent re-learning things I have forgotten.

**It may also be useful for you if you prefer tutorials which are compact yet clear.**
