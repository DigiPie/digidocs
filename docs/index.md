# Welcome to DigiDocs

Hi, I created this website on 20 Dec 17 to document what I learn for easy referencing in the future.

!!!notice "What's up"
    Currently, I am updating this site with notes for DevOps/Operations-related knowledge. You will find information on Linux, Docker and Git under the [DevOps](DevOps/) folder.
This website is maintained by [Evan Tay](http://www.evantay.com), a Computer Science undergraduate at the National University of Singapore.
