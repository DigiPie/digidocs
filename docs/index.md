# DigiDocs

*Last updated on 12 Jan, 2020*

## What is this

DigiDocs is a collection of concise, to-the-point tutorials and references for my personal use. It started out being a way for [me](http://www.evantay.com) to document what I learn in a concise manner. I did so because I wanted to minimise time spent re-learning things I have forgotten.
