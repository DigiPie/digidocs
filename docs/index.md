# What is this
DigiDocs is a collection of concise, to-the-point tutorials for technologies such as Git, Linux and C. These tutorials are organised under chapters such as Git, Linux and C which can be accessed below.

## Who is this for
It is primarily for [me](http://www.evantay.com). I started DigiDocs on 20 December 2017 to document what I learn in concise, bite-sized tutorials. I did so because I wanted to minimise time spent re-learning things I have forgotten.

**It may also be useful for you if you prefer tutorials which are compact yet clear. Check out my tutorials below!**
