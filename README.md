# What is DigiDocs
[DigiDocs](https://digipie.github.io/digidocs/) is a collection of concise, to-the-point tutorials and references for my personal use. It is a way for me to document what I learn in a concise manner. I do so because I want to minimise time spent re-learning things.

# What is SkillsFuture
[SkillsFuture](https://github.com/DigiPie/skillsfuture) is where I do my learning. You will find code and raw notes from my self-learning journey there, and more refined tutorials and references here at DigiDocs.

# How was this built
DigiDocs is built using [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/), a static site generator for project documentation, and the [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme.

The website is deployed at: [digipie.github.io/digidocs/](https://digipie.github.io/digidocs/)
